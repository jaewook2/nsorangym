## Introduction
This project is carried out under the **parent project**  
“Development of RAN Intelligent Controller for O-RAN Intelligence (RS-2023-00225468)”  
and funded as a **sub-project entrusted by ETRI**, titled  
*“Research on Intelligent Control Method for Energy Efficient 5G RAN”*.

## Background
This project is copied from **“A Gymnasium Environment for ns-O-RAN”**,  
and has been modified based on the following software components:

- **e2sim** ([link](https://github.com/wineslab/ns-o-ran-e2-sim))  
- **ns3-oran-mmwave** ([link](https://github.com/wineslab/ns-o-ran-ns3-mmwave))  
- **ns-o-ran** ([link](https://github.com/o-ran-sc/sim-ns3-o-ran-e2))
